Download streamlit with ``pip install streamlit`` if necessary.  
Once the wep app is open, you can use the "Load Conversation" button to load example conversations. For example: `../Conversations/json/BX2.json`.  
To use the Tutor, an OpenAI Azure API key is needed. You can edit the ``Code/key.txt`` file with your key.  

- "Conversations" contains the generated conversations we used for the human et tutoring fidelity evaluations.

- "Human evaluation results" containts the csv file generated by the evaluation form

- "Strategy Fidelity Evaluation" contains our annotated datasets for the Productive Failure fidelity assessment.

- "Assessor Datasets" contains the annotated datasets for the Assessor's tests. It also contains the results of these tests.
