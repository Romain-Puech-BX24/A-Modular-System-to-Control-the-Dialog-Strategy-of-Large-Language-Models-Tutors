        "hey! i'm kinda stuck with this problem... idk what a 'measure of consistency' really means. we haven't learned anything like variance or std deviation yet... do u have any idea where i should start?",
        "ok, so if a player is consistent, their number of goals wouldn\u2019t change much from year to year... right? to show this, i guess i could look at how much their goals scored goes up or down each year? like if it stays around the same number, they'd be consistent. so maybe we could use the difference between each year's goals and the average? how does that sound?",
        "hmm, i could take each player\u2019s goals for a year and subtract the average goals they scored over the 5 years. this would give me how far off they are from their average each year, right? then i could add up these differences... but if they score less in one year and more in another, it will cancel out. so maybe i should make all the differences positive by squaring them? then add those up. wouldn't that tell me something about how consistent they are? the lower the number, the more consistent?",
        "got it, thanks! i\u2019ll try that out. might need to get back to you though! have a good one! Goodbye!"

        "Hello! I am your tutor. Can you walk me through your solution?",
        "Sure, let's think about what consistency might imply in a sports context. What does it mean for a player to be consistent in scoring goals across different years? How might you describe their performance if you wanted to show they maintain a similar level each year?",
        "That's a very good line of reasoning. How might you plan to use these differences in scores to compare the players? What could you do with those differences to help you evaluate consistency?",
        "Exactly, you're on the right track! Give it a try and see what you can come up with using that method. Remember, the goal is to construct your own measure of consistency and justify it based on the data provided. Good luck! If you find yourself needing more guidance, feel free to reach out again. Have a great day!"
