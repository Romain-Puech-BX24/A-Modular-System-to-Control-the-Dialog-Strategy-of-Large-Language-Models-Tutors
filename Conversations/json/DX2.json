        "hey! so i'm a bit lost with this problem. they're asking for measures of consistency, but idk what that means mathematically. got any hints?",
        "umm... i think a consistent player would be someone who scores around the same number of goals each season, not having big ups and downs.",
        "i guess we could look at like how much the number of goals change from year to year for each player, and then see who has the smallest changes? not sure how to do that with math tho.",
        "yeah sure, i'll do that for each player.\n\nfor Mike Arwen, the changes are:\n2008 - 2007: $12 - 13 = -1$\n2009 - 2008: $15 - 12 = 3$\n2010 - 2009: $17 - 15 = 2$\n2011 - 2010: $13 - 17 = -4$\n\nfor Dave Backhand, the changes are:\n2008 - 2007: $14 - 12 = 2$\n2009 - 2008: $16 - 14 = 2$\n2010 - 2009: $15 - 16 = -1$\n2011 - 2010: $13 - 15 = -2$\n\nfor Ivan Right, the changes are:\n2008 - 2007: $10 - 14 = -4$\n2009 - 2008: $18 - 10 = 8$\n2010 - 2009: $18 - 18 = 0$\n2011 - 2010: $15 - 18 = -3$\n\nso those are the year-to-year goal changes. what do i do next?",
        "thanks! so i guess to figure out who's most consistent, we could add up all the absolute changes for each player, 'cause we don't care if they scored more or less, just that the change is small. the player with the smallest total change might be the most consistent?",
        "oh, cool! so i think the next step would be to actually add up the absolute values of those changes for each player.\n\nso for Mike Arwen:\n$|-1| + |3| + |2| + |-4| = 1 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 10$\n\nfor Dave Backhand:\n$|2| + |2| + |-1| + |-2| = 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 7$\n\nand for Ivan Right:\n$|-4| + |8| + |0| + |-3| = 4 + 8 + 0 + 3 = 15$\n\nso if we go by this method, Dave Backhand has the smallest total change, which means he's the most consistent. is this the right way to do it?",
        "Thanks a lot for the help! This was really cool, and I see how you can use math to figure out stuff like consistency. I'll try to remember this method and think about these things for other data in the future.\n\nGoodbye!"

        "Hello! I am your tutor. Can you walk me through your solution?",
        "Of course! When someone mentions consistency in a performance context, what comes to mind for you? How would you describe a player's performance if they are considered \"consistent\"?",
        "That's an excellent intuition. Given your understanding of consistency, how might you use the data to create a measure that reflects this idea?",
        "You're on the right track thinking about the changes from year to year. Mathematically, you can quantify these changes by subtracting the number of goals in one year from the number of goals in the previous year. This gives you a set of differences for each player. Can you try doing that with the data given?",
        "Great work calculating the changes in goals from year to year for each player. Now, consider your definition of consistency and look at the numbers you've calculated. What might be your next step in determining which player is the most consistent based on these changes?",
        "That's an insightful approach! You've touched upon a key concept without realizing it. Now, based on what you've said, what do you think could be the next step in utilizing these total changes to evaluate consistency?",
        "You've done an excellent job working through your approach to measuring consistency. You've created one possible measure and applied it to the data. Reflect on this a bit, and think about how this method you've developed connects to the idea of consistency as you initially defined it. \n\nNow that you have this method, how might it inform the way you look at consistency or variability in other contexts or datasets?\n\nIt was a pleasure discussing this problem with you. Feel free to apply similar thinking to other problems that require measuring consistency. Goodbye!"
