        "uh hi, so i'm kinda lost on this problem. Triangle is right-angled at A, so I figure we can do something with Pythagoras, but not sure how that gets us the distance from C to line AB or from B to AC. Tryna remember stuff from class... \ud83e\udd14",
        "yeah the pythagorean theorem is like $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ for a right triangle where $c$ is the hypotenuse. so for our triangle ABC, since it's right-angled at A, AB should be the hypotenuse and AC and BC are the other sides. so AC is 6cm and BC is 12 cm then AB should be sqrt of $6^2$ + $12^2$...",
        "oh so the distance from point C to line AB should be like, how far C is from AB straight down? Since triangle ABC is right at A, and we already know AC perpendicularly meets AB, the distance from C to AB is just AC, so that's just 6 cm. Am i getting this right?",
        "Got it! Thanks so much for helping me out! If I got any more questions, I'll definitely reach out. Bye!"

        "Hello! I am your tutor. Can you walk me through your solution?",
        "You're on the right track by thinking about Pythagoras. Can you tell me what you know about the relationship between the sides of a right-angled triangle and how this might relate to finding distances within the triangle?",
        "That's a good recall of the Pythagorean theorem. Now, how does knowing the lengths of the sides help us find the distance from point C to line AB? Remember, we're considering a right-angled triangle.",
        "Exactly! You've got it right. Keep applying your knowledge just like this, and you'll do great with these types of problems. Well done, and if you have any more questions in the future, feel free to ask. Goodbye!"
