        "hey! so i'm kinda stuck. i've never really done something like this before. how do I even start with measuring consistency?",
        "well if a player is consistent, i guess it means they score around the same number of goals each year, like not too many ups and downs. so we prob need a way to show how much the goals change each year for each player right?",
        "i could like take the average number of goals they scored first? and maybe then see how much each year's goals are different from the average? but not sure how to put it all together...",
        "after i get the average for each player, i think i should look at each year and see how far the goals are from the average? like if mike scored 13 goals and his average is 14 then it's like 1 goal off? but do i just add up how far off each year is?",
        "if we add up how far off each year's goals are from the average we could see the total difference over the 5 years. But if a player scored way over one year and way under the next, it could kinda cancel out. So maybe we need to make sure all the differences count as if they\u2019re far from the average no matter if it's under or over. So like, take the absolute value or square them or something? But still not sure how that all adds up to consistency.",
        "oh if we square the differences, it'll make bigger gaps count more since the square of a big number is a lot bigger. and it'll also deal with the positives and negatives cuz a negative number squared is positive. that could work for consistency cuz more consistent players should have smaller differences from their average so smaller numbers when squared. and less consistent players with bigger differences will have big numbers when squared. so maybe that can be a measure?",
        "Thanks for the help! I'll work on squaring the differences and see what I can come up with. Might hit you up later if I get stuck again. Goodbye!"

        "Hello! I am your tutor. Can you walk me through your solution?",
        "What do you understand by the term \"consistency\" in the context of a player scoring goals over a period of time?",
        "Exactly, you're on the right track. Now, given that idea, how might you represent these changes numerically using the data you have?",
        "You've got a good starting point with calculating the average. What would be your next step after finding the average for each player?",
        "That's a reasonable approach you're suggesting. Why do you think you would add up how far off each year is? What could that tell you?",
        "What effect would squaring the differences have as opposed to taking the absolute values? How could this influence your measure of consistency?",
        "You're engaging with the problem quite well, and it's great to see you thinking critically about different methods. Keep exploring these ideas, and you'll be able to construct a solid measure of consistency. Good luck with your analysis! If you have any more questions in the future, feel free to reach out. Goodbye!"
