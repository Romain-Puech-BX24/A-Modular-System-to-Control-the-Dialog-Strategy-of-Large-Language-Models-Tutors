        "Oh hey! I'm kinda lost with this problem.\n\nI think we need to divide the seats relative to the population of each state, right? But I'm not sure how to divide the seats fairly. How do I start? \ud83d\ude15",
        "Hmm, I guess I would need to know like the total population of the whole country first? I could add up the populations of all the states, right? Then I would divide the total number of seats by the total population maybe? \ud83e\udd14",
        "Alright! Here goes the math:\n\nTotal population would be the sum of all the states:\n$1,646,000 + 6,936,000 + 154,000 + 2,091,000 + 685,000 + 988,000$\n\nSo the total population is:\n$1,646,000 + 6,936,000 + 154,000 + 2,091,000 + 685,000 + 988,000 = 12,500,000$\n\nNow, I guess I should get some sort of \"rate\" or \"ratio\" of seats to population. I'd divide the total number of seats by the total population:\n$\\frac{250}{12,500,000}$\n\nThat gives me a ratio of:\n$\\frac{250}{12,500,000} = \\frac{1}{50,000}$\n\nSo, for every 50,000 people, there should be 1 seat in the legislative body.\n\nIs this looking right so far? \ud83e\uddd0",
        "Thanks! So next I guess I need to figure out how many seats each state gets.\n\nFor that, I think I have to multiply the population of each state by the ratio I found?\n\nLike for state A with a population of $1,646,000$, it would be:\n$1,646,000 \\times \\frac{1}{50,000}$\n\nLet me do that calculation for state A... \ud83e\uddee\nIt's $1646000 \\div 50000$ which gives $32.92$.\n\nWe can't have a fraction of a seat, so I think I have to round to the nearest whole number, right?\nThat means state A would get $33$ seats.\n\nDo I do this for all states now? \ud83e\udd14",
        "Oh right, rounding could be tricky 'cause if we just round normally, we might end up with too many or too few seats when we add them all up. I think we're supposed to keep the total at exactly 250 seats.\n\nMaybe we could use something like rounding down always, and then give the extra seats to the states with the largest remainders? Does that make sense? \ud83e\udd28",
        "Okay, so my next step would be to figure out how many seats each state gets by rounding down the results, that way I make sure I don't go over 250 seats.\n\nSo for state A, when I did the multiplication I got $32.92$ which would round down to $32$ seats. \n\nI think I need to do this same process for states B, C, D, E, and F. And then, I'll see how many seats we have left and give those extra seats to the states with the largest decimal parts. I\u2019ll have to keep track of the remainders.\n\nShould I go ahead and calculate the seat numbers for all states first? \ud83e\udd13",
        "I'll go ahead and calculate the seat numbers for each state then! Just rounding down at first:\n\nState B: \n$6,936,000 \\times \\frac{1}{50,000} = 138.72$ \nSo, $138$ seats after rounding down.\n\nState C: \n$154,000 \\times \\frac{1}{50,000} = 3.08$ \nSo, $3$ seats after rounding down.\n\nState D:\n$2,091,000 \\times \\frac{1}{50,000} = 41.82$ \nSo, $41$ seats after rounding down.\n\nState E: \n$685,000 \\times \\frac{1}{50,000} = 13.7$ \nSo, $13$ seats after rounding down.\n\nState F: \n$988,000 \\times \\frac{1}{50,000} = 19.76$ \nSo, $19$ seats after rounding down.\n\nNow I'll add these to make sure they don't go over 250.\n\n$32+138+3+41+13+19 = 246$\n\nOkay, looks like we have $246$. So, we have $4$ seats left 'cause we need a total of $250$. Time to distribute the remaining seats to the states with the largest decimal remainders.\n\nFrom my calculations the remainders were:\nState A - .92\nState B - .72\nState C - .08\nState D - .82\nState E - .7\nState F - .76\n\nSo the seats should go to states A, B, D, and F.\n\nThat will make the seat numbers:\nState A - 33\nState B - 139\nState C - 3\nState D - 42\nState E - 13\nState F - 20\n\nThis should add up to 250 now.\n$33+139+3+42+13+20 = 250$\n\nSo I think that would fairly distribute the seats?\n\nAm I doing this right? \ud83d\ude43",
        "Okay, recap time. So what I did first was find the total population of the new country by adding all the state populations. That was $12,500,000$ people.\n\nNext, I figured out how many people each seat in the legislative body would represent by dividing the total population by the 250 seats. That was 1 seat for every 50,000 people.\n\nThen, I multiplied each state's population by the ratio $\\frac{1}{50,000}$. I rounded down the resulting numbers to avoid going over the total 250 seats. After this, I distributed the remaining seats to the states with the largest decimal remainders to get as close as possible to their exact proportion of the population.\n\nThis method aims to be fair because it tries to give each state representation proportional to its population. It doesn't perfectly match the ratios because of the rounding, but by assigning left over seats to those with the highest decimals, it gets as close as possible.\n\nThe goal of the seat allocation is to make sure each resident of the country has roughly equal representation in the legislative body, no matter which state they're from. With the method I used, the allocation of seats reflects the principle of proportionality, which is a big part of achieving fairness in representation.\n\nSo yeah, I guess by using proportionality I tried to distribute the seats fairly according to each state's population. Does that sound right? \ud83d\ude05",
        "Got it, thank you so much for helping me figure this out! I learned a lot about fairness and proportionality today. I'll remember to reach out if I get stuck on another problem. Goodbye! \ud83d\udc4b\ud83d\ude0a"

    "pb": "A new country has recently been founded.\nThe country is split into six states, call them A, B, C, D, E, and F. \nThe population of state A is 1,646,000 people, the population of state B is 6,936,000 people, the population of state C is 154,000 people, the population of state D is 2,091,000 people, the population of state E is 685,000 people, and the population of state F is 988,000 people.\nThere are 250 seats available on a legislative body to govern the new country. \nHow many seats should be assigned to each state so that each state would receive a fair representation? \nShow your work and justify why you think your method is correct.",
    "sol": "To solve this problem, we want to assign the 250 legislative seats to each state in such a way that the representation aligns as closely as possible with the population of each state. A common method to distribute seats in a way that is proportionally fair is using the method of largest remainders (also known as the Hamilton method). Here's a step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Calculate the total population.**\n   Add up the populations of all the states to find the total population of the country.\n\n   Total population = 1,646,000 (A) + 6,936,000 (B) + 154,000 (C) + 2,091,000 (D) + 685,000 (E) + 988,000 (F)      \n                     = 12,500,000\n\n2. **Calculate the standard divisor.**\n   Divide the total population by the number of available seats to determine the standard divisor, which is the average population represented by one seat.\n\n   Standard divisor = Total population / Number of seats\n                    = 12,500,000 / 250\n                    = 50,000\n\n3. **Calculate the initial quota for each state.**\n   Divide the population of each state by the standard divisor to determine how many whole seats each state should receive initially, rounding down to the nearest whole number.\n\n   Initial quotas:\n   - A: 1,646,000 / 50,000 = 32.92 -> 32 seats\n   - B: 6,936,000 / 50,000 = 138.72 -> 138 seats\n   - C: 154,000 / 50,000 = 3.08 -> 3 seats\n   - D: 2,091,000 / 50,000 = 41.82 -> 41 seats\n   - E: 685,000 / 50,000 = 13.70 -> 13 seats\n   - F: 988,000 / 50,000 = 19.76 -> 19 seats\n\n4. **Add up the initial quotas and calculate the surplus seats.**\n   After assigning the initial whole number of seats, see how many seats are left over that need to be distributed.\n\n   Total initial seats assigned = 32 + 138 + 3 + 41 + 13 + 19\n                               = 246\n\n   Seats left to distribute = 250 - 246\n                            = 4\n\n5. **Distribute the surplus seats based on largest remainders.**\n   The remainders from the initial quotas will determine who gets the surplus seats. Assign these seats to the states with the largest remainders until all surplus seats are distributed.\n\n   Remainders:\n   - A: 0.92\n   - B: 0.72\n   - C: 0.08\n   - D: 0.82\n   - E: 0.70\n   - F: 0.76\n\n   The four highest remainders are from states A, B, D, and F. Give one extra seat to each.\n\n6. **Final seat distribution.**\n   Update the initial quotas with the surplus seats distributed:\n\n   Final distribution:\n   - A: 32 + 1 = 33 seats\n   - B: 138 + 1 = 139 seats\n   - C: 3 + 0 = 3 seats\n   - D: 41 + 1 = 42 seats\n   - E: 13 + 0 = 13 seats\n   - F: 19 + 1 = 20 seats\n\n   Check: 33 + 139 + 3 + 42 + 13 + 20 = 250 seats\n\nTherefore, the final fair representation based on the largest remainder method would assign 33 seats to state A, 139 seats to state B, 3 seats to state C, 42 seats to state D, 13 seats to state E, and 20 seats to state F for a total of 250 seats. This approach ensures that the representation is as proportionally fair as possible according to the populations of the states."
