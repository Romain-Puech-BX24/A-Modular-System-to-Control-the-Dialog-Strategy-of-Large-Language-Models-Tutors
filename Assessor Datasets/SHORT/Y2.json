        "{\"justification\": \"The student is expressing difficulty with starting the problem and is asking the tutor for guidance on how to approach it. This indicates that the student is not using or suggesting a wrong method (a) but is instead asking for help to solve the problem (g). There is no evidence of algebraic manipulation (b), numerical error (c), or an intuitive or incomplete solution (d). The student's answer is clear in expressing their need for assistance (e), and since they have not provided a solution, we cannot say they have answered a question correctly (f). They have not asked for a specific theorem (h) or a numerical calculation (i). The student and tutor have not yet arrived at a solution (j, k). The student does not show a strong lack of motivation (l) but does show a lack of self-confidence (m) by stating they are 'kinda stuck' and unsure how to start.\", \"selection\": \"gm\"}",
        "{\"justification\": \"The student has understood the tutor's hint and is proceeding with the correct first step of the problem, which is to calculate the total population of the country. This shows that the student is now on the right path (f) and is performing a numerical calculation (i). There is no evidence of the student using a wrong method (a), making an algebraic manipulation error (b), or providing an intuitive or incomplete solution (d). The student's answer is clear and not ambiguous (e), and they are not asking about how to solve the problem anymore (g) nor asking the tutor to state a specific theorem (h). The student and tutor have not yet arrived at a complete solution for the entirety of the initial *Problem Statement* (j, k). The student does not show a strong lack of motivation (l) or a strong lack of self-confidence (m) in this utterance.\", \"selection\": \"fi\"}",

This indicates that the student has correctly answered the tutor's previous question (f) and has not made a numerical error (c). There is no evidence of the student using a wrong method (a), making an algebraic manipulation error (b), providing an intuitive or incomplete solution (d), or asking for further assistance (g, h, i).

This matches the calculation in the provided solution. The student has correctly answered the tutor's previous question (f) and has not made a numerical error (c). There is no evidence of the student using a wrong method (a), making an algebraic manipulation error (b), providing an intuitive or incomplete solution (d), or asking for further assistance (g, h, i).

        "{\"justification\": \"The student is correctly suggesting the next step in the process, which is to divide the population of each state by the standard divisor to determine the initial allocation of seats (f). They are proceeding with the correct method and are about to perform the necessary numerical calculations (i). There is no evidence of the student using a wrong method (a), making an algebraic manipulation error (b), making a numerical error (c), providing an intuitive or incomplete solution (d), or asking for further assistance (g, h).

        "{\"justification\": \"The student has correctly performed the calculations for the initial allocation of seats for each state, rounding down to the nearest whole number as instructed by the tutor (f). They have also correctly identified that the sum of the initial allocations is 246, which is 4 seats short of the total 250 seats available (c). The student is now asking for guidance on how to distribute the remaining 4 seats, which shows they understand the need for an additional step but are unsure of the exact method to use (g). The student's answer is clear and not ambiguous (e). The student and tutor have not yet arrived at a complete solution for the entirety of the initial *Problem Statement* (j, k).

        "{\"justification\": \"The student has correctly identified the largest fractional parts after rounding down the initial seat allocations and has accurately determined which states should receive the additional seats (f). They have also correctly updated the seat count for each state and verified that the total number of seats allocated equals 250 (j). The student's approach is consistent with the method of largest remainders, which is the method provided in the *Provided Solution* (k).

They have acknowledged the complexity and imperfections of the seat allocation methods, showing a deeper level of engagement with the material. The student does not exhibit a lack of motivation or self-confidence; instead, they are curious and interested in the application of mathematics in real-world scenarios (l, m).
