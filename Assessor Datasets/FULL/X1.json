        "{\"justification\": \"The student expresses confusion about the task, indicating they do not understand what is meant by 'measures of consistency' and is unsure how to proceed with comparing the players' goals. This shows that the student is asking for help to solve the problem, which corresponds to feedback g. There is no indication of a lack of motivation or self-confidence, just a request for clarification and assistance.\", \"selection\": \"g\"}",
        "{\"justification\": \"The student is providing an intuitive approach to the problem by suggesting that a consistent player would have goal numbers that do not vary too much from year to year. They are considering the variation in goals as well as the closeness of the goal numbers to each other, which is a step towards conceptualizing a measure of consistency. This shows that the student is thinking about the problem and trying to come up with a solution, which corresponds to feedback d. The student is also seeking validation for their thoughts by asking if they make sense, which could indicate a slight lack of self-confidence, but it is not strong enough to be considered feedback m.\", \"selection\": \"d\"}",
        "{\"justification\": \"The student is suggesting a method that involves finding the difference between the goals scored each year and an average number, which is a step towards calculating variance or standard deviation, even though they are not using those terms. The student correctly identifies that smaller differences could indicate greater consistency, which aligns with the concept of variance. However, they are unsure about which average to use or how to proceed with the calculation, indicating they need further guidance, corresponding to feedback g. The student's solution is still intuitive and incomplete, as they have not yet arrived at a specific method or formula, which corresponds to feedback d.\", \"selection\": \"dg\"}",
        "{\"justification\": \"The student has correctly identified the mean (average goals per year) as a significant average to reflect a player's performance over the period in question. They describe the correct process for calculating the mean by adding up all the goals scored over the 5 years and dividing by 5. This shows that the student understands the concept of an average and how it can be used to measure consistency, which corresponds to feedback f. The student's solution is becoming clearer and more complete, but they have not yet arrived at a complete solution for the entirety of the initial problem statement, so feedback j and k do not apply.\", \"selection\": \"f\"}",
        "{\"justification\": \"The student has correctly calculated the average number of goals per year for each player, which is a necessary step in analyzing the players' consistency. They have demonstrated an understanding of the process and have performed the correct arithmetic operations to find the averages. This indicates that the student has correctly answered the tutor's previous question and is on the right path to solving the problem, which corresponds to feedback f. The student has not made any errors in their calculations, and they are not asking for help or clarification in this utterance, so none of the other feedback options apply.\", \"selection\": \"f\"}",
        "{\"justification\": \"The student is correctly identifying the next step in the process, which is to calculate the deviation of each year's goals from the average for each player. They also correctly realize that simply adding up the differences could result in positive and negative values canceling each other out, and thus they suggest taking the absolute value of the differences. This shows a good understanding of the concept of absolute deviation, which is a measure of consistency. The student is on the right track and is proceeding with the calculations, which corresponds to feedback f. They have not yet completed the solution, so feedback j and k do not apply.\", \"selection\": \"f\"}",
        "{\"justification\": \"The student has correctly calculated the sum of absolute differences for each player and used this information to determine the most consistent player. They have understood that the player with the smallest sum of absolute differences is the most consistent, which is a valid method for measuring consistency. The student has not made any errors in their calculations and has arrived at a complete solution for the problem statement, which corresponds to feedback f. They have also completed the solution for the entirety of the initial problem statement, which corresponds to feedback j. However, the method they used is not the same as the variance method provided in the provided solution, so feedback k does not apply.\", \"selection\": \"fj\"}",
        "{\"justification\": \"The student recognizes the limitation of using the sum of absolute differences, noting that it does not account for the spread of a player's performance. They then suggest squaring the differences before adding them up, which is indeed the concept of variance, and taking the square root of the total, which refers to the standard deviation. The student is on the right track with their reasoning and is asking for help to understand the concept better, which corresponds to feedback g. They have not yet arrived at a complete solution using this new method, so feedback j and k do not apply. The student's answer is clear and shows a good understanding of the concepts, so feedback e does not apply either.\", \"selection\": \"g\"}",
        "{\"justification\": \"The student correctly explains the consequences of squaring the differences and the purpose of taking the square root afterward, which is to calculate the standard deviation. They understand that squaring emphasizes larger differences and that taking the square root brings the scale back to the original units, making it comparable to the original data. The student is demonstrating a good understanding of the concepts of variance and standard deviation and is ready to proceed with the calculations, which corresponds to feedback f. They have not yet completed the solution using this new method, so feedback j and k do not apply. The student's answer is clear and shows a good understanding of the concepts, so feedback e does not apply either.\", \"selection\": \"f\"}",
        "{\"justification\": \"The student has correctly outlined the steps to calculate what they refer to as the 'standard deviation' of each player's performances, which involves squaring the differences, summing them, and then taking the square root. They are seeking confirmation before proceeding, which indicates they want to ensure they are on the right track, corresponding to feedback g. The student has not yet completed the solution using this new method, so feedback j and k do not apply. The student's answer is clear and shows a good understanding of the concepts, so feedback e does not apply either.\", \"selection\": \"g\"}",
        "{\"justification\": \"The student has now correctly recalled the steps for calculating the variance and standard deviation, including dividing the sum of the squared differences by the number of data points before taking the square root. They have demonstrated a clear understanding of the process and are ready to apply it to the data for each player, which corresponds to feedback f. The student has not yet completed the solution using this new method, so feedback j and k do not apply. The student's answer is clear and shows a good understanding of the concepts, so feedback e does not apply either.\", \"selection\": \"f\"}",
