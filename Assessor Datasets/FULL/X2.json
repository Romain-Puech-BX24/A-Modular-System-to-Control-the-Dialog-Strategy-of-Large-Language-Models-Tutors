        "{\"justification\": \"The student is unsure about how to approach the problem, indicating a lack of understanding of the method to use, which suggests they are asking for guidance on how to solve the problem. There is no numerical or algebraic error since the student has not attempted any calculation yet. The student's answer is not complete, as they have not provided a solution but are instead asking for help to understand how to measure consistency. There is no indication of a lack of motivation or a lack of self-confidence; the student is simply seeking assistance.\", \"selection\": \"dg\"}",
        "{\"justification\": \"The student has suggested a method to start comparing the players by calculating their average number of goals over the five years. This is a correct approach to begin assessing consistency, as it provides a baseline to compare the fluctuations in their performance. The student has not made any errors and is not asking for a specific theorem or calculation from the tutor. They are building on the tutor's guidance and are not showing signs of a lack of motivation or self-confidence.\", \"selection\": \"f\"}",
        "{\"justification\": \"The student has correctly calculated the average number of goals for each player, which is the first step in assessing consistency. They have not made any errors in their calculations and have correctly answered the tutor's question. The student also recognizes that while the averages provide some information, they are not sufficient to determine consistency, indicating an understanding that another measure is needed. This shows that the student is thinking critically about the problem and is aware that further analysis is required. There is no indication of a lack of motivation or self-confidence.\", \"selection\": \"f\"}",
        "{\"justification\": \"The student has correctly identified that they need to measure the deviation of each player's goals from their average to assess consistency. They are suggesting a method that involves calculating the absolute differences between each year's goals and the average, which is a valid approach to measure consistency. The student is not making any errors; instead, they are proposing a logical next step in the analysis. They are asking for confirmation from the tutor, which shows they are engaged and seeking to ensure they are on the right path. There is no indication of a lack of motivation or self-confidence.\", \"selection\": \"fg\"}",
        "{\"justification\": \"The student has proposed a method to sum the absolute differences from the average for each player over the five years, which is a reasonable approach to measure consistency. This method would indeed give an indication of which player's performance has been the most stable over the period in question. The student is asking for confirmation to proceed with the calculation, which shows they are engaged and want to make sure they are on the right track before continuing. There are no errors in their reasoning, and they are not showing a lack of motivation or self-confidence.\", \"selection\": \"fg\"}",
        "{\"justification\": \"The student has correctly applied the method they proposed by calculating the absolute differences from the average for each player and summing them up. They have not made any numerical errors in their calculations and have logically concluded that Dave Backhand is the most consistent player based on the total differences being the lowest. The student has followed through with their plan and is asking for validation of their method, which shows they are looking for confirmation that their approach is sound. There is no indication of a lack of motivation or self-confidence.\", \"selection\": \"fj\"}",
        "{\"justification\": \"The student has understood the tutor's hint about the potential issue with simply summing the absolute differences. They have correctly identified that squaring the differences would give more weight to larger deviations, which is indeed the concept of variance. The student is connecting this new understanding to prior knowledge and is asking for confirmation to proceed with calculating the variance. This shows that the student is critically thinking about the problem and is capable of adjusting their approach based on feedback. There is no indication of a lack of motivation or self-confidence.\", \"selection\": \"fg\"}",
        "{\"justification\": \"The student has correctly explained the effect of squaring the differences on the measure of consistency, demonstrating an understanding of how this approach emphasizes larger deviations. They have recognized that this method is akin to calculating variance and are asking for confirmation to proceed with the calculations. The student is showing a good grasp of the concepts involved and is actively engaging with the problem-solving process. There is no indication of a lack of motivation or self-confidence.\", \"selection\": \"fg\"}",
        "{\"justification\": \"The student has correctly applied the concept of variance to the data by squaring the differences between each player's goals and their average, then summing these squared differences. They have not made any numerical errors in their calculations and have logically concluded that Dave Backhand is the most consistent player based on this measure. The student has followed through with the new approach and is asking for validation of their method, which shows they are looking for confirmation that their approach is sound. There is no indication of a lack of motivation or self-confidence.\", \"selection\": \"fj\"}",
        "{\"justification\": \"The student has correctly summarized the concept of standard deviation as the square root of the variance and expressed an understanding of its relevance in terms of bringing the measure back to the original units. They have shown an appreciation for the application of statistical concepts to real-world examples and have indicated readiness to explain their chosen measure of consistency. The student has thanked the tutor for the guidance, showing that they value the learning process and are satisfied with the outcome. There is no further calculation required at this point, and the student does not exhibit a lack of motivation or self-confidence.\", \"selection\": \"fj\"}"
